# COVID

COVID is an R package that implements the two robust methods described in Lin et al. (2022) to assess the totality of evidence for the treatment effects on the entire clinical course of a patient using daily clinical outcomes. The use of the software is documented in “COVID-vignette.pdf”, and a user guide is provided in “COVID-manual.pdf”.

In addition, we develop a SAS macro that fits marginal proportional hazards models for multiple events and combines the evidence of treatment effects using the Wei, Lin and Weissfeld (1989, JASA) method. A user guide is provided in “WLW.pdf”.
